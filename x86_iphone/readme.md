# x86 finds its way into your iPhone

### Introduction
In one of my several lives, I'm supposed to be a vulnerability researcher working on baseband exploitation. As every vulnerability researcher knows, being up to date with recent developments is of utmost importance for the success of your job. So of course, after Apple announced its new, shiny, big, bigger and biggest line of iPhone smartphones, I downloaded some OTA firmwares from ipsw.me and started to look into the new baseband firmware.

What I discovered sent a shiver of horror down my spine, the kind of horror that only playing Doom at nighttime, alone in your room, without lights, can produce. Bear with me and I'll tell you what I found...

*NOTE*: this is just some preliminary analysis and I'm not going to describe anything related to baseband rerversing, it's not the scope of this document.

### Who/What/Where?
The baseband cpu is a standalone core that lives in your phone and is responsible for managing 2g/3g/4g/cdma/5g wireless communications. Given the absurd complexity of these standards, today a baseband cpu must be very powerful and enough general purpose, so the days of custom FPGA based IPs are long gone, at least for the main part. A lot has been said and written about basebands on modern smartphones, so I won't repeat it. For our purpose, you just need to know that usually basebands are implemented using embedded friendly CPUs, like for example ARM (Cortex-M, Cortex-R or something inbetween), Qualcomm Hexagon (a kind of general purpose, VLIW dsp) or other more or less known architectures.

Apple is nothing special in this regard, up until the iPhone8/iPhoneX, they used to have two different basebands, one for CDMA markets and one for everything else. The CDMA one was based on Qualcomm Hexagon dsp, while the GSM one was based on Intel XMMxxxx architecture. For those that like to play around with iPhone firmwares, you might have seen MAVxxx and ICExxx files in the ipsw, well those two files contain the firmware respectively for Qualcomm based devices (MAV) and Intel based ones (ICE).

As you may know, Apple decided to drop Qualcomm and now they're using exclusively Intel based basebands, so we will concentrate on this.

### The old Intel baseband
Let's take a look at the old generation of Intel baseband, the one used up to iPhoneX. If you download an ipsw GSM firmware and unzip it (ipsw files are just zip files), there will be, amongst other things, a "Firmware" folder. Inside this folder you will see a couple of files: "ICE17-1.04.52.Release.bbfw" and "Mav17-1.91.00.Release.bbfw". The version will change of course, these are for iPhone8 with iOS 11.4beta3. Those files are again zip files and we're interested in ICE17-xxx, let's unzip it and see the contents:

```

lot of stuff here. People familiar with embedded firmware reversing, will set their eyes on "psi_ram.bin" and "ebl.bin" of course. A quick hex dump of their content, will immediately reveal that they contain ARM code. As a matter of fact, "psi_ram.bin" is the stage0 bootloader, that will load "ebl.bin" at some address and jump to its entry point. ebl.bin will then load all other files and jump to the main firmware, contained in SYS_SW.elf. Just to be sure, let us fire IDA and open psi_ram.bin for example, load address does not matter, just set it to 0:

nothing strange here, it's your standard embedded ARM boot code, with some custom setup related to this specific SoC. Moving on, psi_ram will load ebl and jump into it, you can find the code yourself, is not that complex.
The important thing is, this is ARM code.

### The new Intel baseband...the horror...the horror...
Waking up this morning, I wanted to analyse the new baseband firmware, to get an idea of what changed and where. So I downloaded a random OTA for the new iPhones from ipsw.me, in particular: https://ipsw.me/otas/iPhone11,2 , which should be the new iPhone Xs. I went through the usual stages (downloading, unzipping, unzipping, unzipping, copying, etc...), I load psi_ram.bin into IDA, I select ARM little endian, and...huge chunk of undefined data. I press "C" like an idiot for about 200 times, I reload the file multiple times, I try another IDA version, I try to disassemble the bytes with Capstone, I DISASSEMBLE THEM MANUALLY, nothing...all I got was invalid code. So I went back to sleep because obviously it was not a good day.

I wake up again after about an hour, I download again the ipsw for the same model and I go through all the same steps as usual. Still invalid code. My first guess was that the code is encrypted, so I use some random tool to analyse the entropy, nothing, it's very low. Ok, you cannot trust tools these days, so I wrote my own script to calculate the entropy and again, is too low to be encrypted and anyway, it was also clear by a quick "eye" analysis, even though you should not trust your eyes that much.

I stare at the screen for several minutes, thinking what the fu** is going on. But of course, as a reverser you should never give up, so I try EVERY POSSIBLE RISC ARCHITECTURE I KNOW, and trust me, there's a lot of them (no I mean, A LOT, I reversed everything from Dreamcast SH4 to Fujitsu/Siemens running inside my Nikon D90), and...

Nothing, all I get is garbage. My next guess is: ok then, it's encrypted with some entropy-preserving algorithm. I try some cryptoanalisis approaches I know, even though is not my main job and I'm no expert at it, still nothing.

I make another coffee and I start to think, in my mind, as a joke: fuck it, this is x86 because Intel has gone insane. I start to laugh maniacally at the idea, but you know, I had tried everything, so I reopen "psi_ram.bin" and I leave the default "MetaPC" architecture in IDA, and...

I could not believe my eyes...I was looking at embedded x86 code running inside a baseband processor. I thought that it was just random chance, that somehow I ended up with valid x86 code, so I look at another function (note: IDA automatically resolved most of the code) and....
```
seg000:0000DFD0 sub_DFD0        proc near               ; CODE XREF: sub_DF4D+7A↑p
seg000:0000DFD0

seg000:0000DFD0
seg000:0000DFD0                 mov     eax, [esp+arg_0]
seg000:0000DFD4                 lgdt    fword ptr [eax]
seg000:0000DFD7                 mov     ax, 10h
seg000:0000DFDB                 mov     ds, eax
seg000:0000DFDD                 assume ds:nothing
seg000:0000DFDD                 mov     es, eax
seg000:0000DFDF                 assume es:nothing
seg000:0000DFDF                 mov     ss, eax
seg000:0000DFE1                 assume ss:nothing
seg000:0000DFE1                 mov     ax, 18h
seg000:0000DFE5                 mov     gs, eax
seg000:0000DFE7                 assume gs:nothing
seg000:0000DFE7                 jmp     far ptr 8:0FF90DFEEh
seg000:0000DFE7 sub_DFD0        endp
```

holy sh*t...lgdt...mov ds, eax...jmp far ptr 8:xxx, you can't get more x86 than this. This is no coincidence, this MUST be valid x86 code...I was totally speechless, and partially in awe, because this reminds me of my younger days when I was writing bootloaders and operating systems that run in protected mode.

But my rational part told me "hey, probably they just decided to boot the system with an embedded x86 mcu, OBVIOUSLY the main firmware still runs on ARM", so I turn my attention to "SYS_SW.elf", the main firmware. I look at the ELF header, and it says ARM...good. I load it in IDA, and I get garbage...AGAIN!!!! I think "what.the.fuck" and I try to load it with MetaPC again and...BOOM, valid x86 code!

this is awesome...

### Conclusions
Nothing really, I just found this funny and wanted to share.
If you ever felt like you missed an x86 core in your life, now you have one (or several? I still need to investigate) always with you, so you won't feel alone ever again.
I still did not have time to analyse the other models, but my guess is that they're also running on x86.

What will happen next? Are we going to get a z80 inside our phones? Why not a 6502? Hell, I would love to run C64 basic interpreter natively inside my phone....

No really, I'm not criticizing Apple or Intel for using an x86 core, I don't really care, but...my PERSONAL opinion is that something is going really wrong in this world.
